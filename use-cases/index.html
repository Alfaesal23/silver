			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this document is to outline situations in which ensuring conformance of websites and applications might present a challenge for content providers, despite best intentions and efforts. The intent of this document is to help form a shared understanding of such situations, to contribute to the development of accessibility resources. These resources could include:
			<ul>
				<li>Technical standards for accessibility, such as <a href="">W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0</a> and [[[ATAG20]]].
    			<li>Accompanying technical guidance, such as <a href="">Understanding WCAG 2</a> , <a href="">Techniques for WCAG 2</a> , and similar resources being considered for WCAG 3</li>
    			<li>Advisory guidance from WAI, such as Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility, Planning and Managing Web Accessibility, and Developing an Accessibility Statement</li>
    			<li>Other potential resources, such as Maturity Model and Conformance Challenges</li>
			</ul>

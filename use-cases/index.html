			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this document is to outline situations in which ensuring conformance of websites and applications might present a challenge for content providers, despite best intentions and efforts. The intent of this document is to help form a shared understanding of such situations, to contribute to the development of accessibility resources. These resources could include:
			<ul>
				<li>Technical standards for accessibility, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/">W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessiiblity Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</a></li>
    			<li>Accompanying technical guidance, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/">Understanding WCAG 2</a> , <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/">Techniques for WCAG 2</a>, and similar resources being considered for WCAG 3</li> 
    			<li>Advisory guidance from WAI, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies/">Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/">Planning and Managing Web Accessibility</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/">Developing an Accessibility Statement</a></li>
    			<li>Other potential resources, such as <a href="https://w3c.github.io/maturity-model/">Maturity Model</a>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="problem">Problem Description</h2>
			<p>Content providers encounter situations where trying to make content conform to accessibility requirements might present challenges for them, despite best intentions and efforts. For example, when they are publishing large volumes of content, managing third-party content, and when they are adopting new technologies such as natural language interfaces and immersive environments. They then need to decide if they need to pull or not publish the content, versus seek more pragmatic approaches to address the situations. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/">WCAG 3</a> and other resources from WAI, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/">Planning and Managing Web Accessibility</a>, have the goal to support content providers in such situations. However, we lack a shared understanding and common description of these situations across the different WAI groups. This makes some discussions less effective. Moreover, not all challenges can be resolved alone through technical standards and resources from WAI. Some challenges need to be addressed through accessibility policies that are not developed by WAI. For example, most accessibility policies, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and European Accessibility Act (EAA), include concepts around <em>reasonable accommodation</em> and <em>undue burden</em>. That is, we need to understand the context around the situations. Some of them are more technical in nature, and others are more policy related. Understanding this helps us approach the parts that fall within the scope of WAI. </p>

			<h2 id="approach">Approach and Structure</h2>
			<p>This document provides a collection of situations where trying to make content accessible might present challenges for content providers. The intent is to identify common patterns across the different situations, and help form a shared understanding for them. This could contribute to the development of accessibility resources from WAI. This includes informing the development of the conformance model and provisions in WCAG 3. Another potential outcome could be WAI guidance with considerations for policy makers wanting to adopt WCAG.</p>

			<p>Each situation in this document is illustrated with one or more brief example scenario. Each situation also includes a high-level outline of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How technical standards might contribute to addressing the situation</li>
    			<li>How accompanying guidance might contribute to addressing the situation</li>
    			<li>How accessibility policies might contribute to addressing the situation</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The situations and examples cover a broad range of sectors, including public, commercial, education, and more. However, they are not in any way exhaustive. The situations are also not mutually exclusive - multiple situations could be applicable to the same content at the same time.</p>

			<p>The situations and examples are not intended to cover the all too frequent instances where content providers fail to consider accessibility requirements, whether out of ignorance or negligence. These are real concerns that need to be addressed. They are simply outside the scope of this particular document. In this document we intentionally presume that content providers are doing their best to consider accessibility to the extent they reasonably can. </p>

		<section>
			<h2 id="keyTerms">Key Terminology and Concepts</h2>
			<p>Some of the key terms and concepts used in this document include the following:
			<ul>
    			<li><strong>Content Provider:</strong> person or entity providing content to others, for example through a website, mobile app, and other user interfaces. </li>
    			<li><strong>Content Creator:</strong> person or entity creating the content. This includes content in different formats, such as text, code, audio, and video.</li>
    			<li><strong>Content Owner:</strong> person or entity owning the content. This can be the commissioner of the content or another holder of the rights.</li>
    			<li><strong>Conformance:</strong> adhering to technical standards. In this context accessibility standards, such as the W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</li>
    			<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> adhering to laws and other types of policies. In this context accessibility policies, such as the European Accessibility Act (EAA).</li>
    			<li><strong>Relative priority for people with disabilities:</strong> in the context of this document refers to prioritizing certain content before other content, not to exclude any content as irrelevant for people with disabilities. For example, a restaurant owner might prioritize improving accessibility of the information on accessibility of the restaurant before improving accessibility of the picture gallery.</li>
    			<li><strong>Reasonable efforts concepts:</strong> refers to concepts such as "reasonable accommodation" and "undue burden" that exist in many policies, such as Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and European Accessibility Act (EAA).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not intended to be any glossary definition of the terms, just an introduction of these concepts in the context of this document. If accepted by the group, these terms used in the finalized documents may be considered for aligning with and adding to the corresponding glossary definitions. </p>

			<h2 id="situations">Situations</h2>
			<section>
				<h3 id="situation-1">Situation 1: Bugs and other issues of oversight occur in content</h3>
				<p>In this situation the content provider is committed to accessibility but, despite all efforts, virtually all software has bugs and other issues of oversight. 
				</p>
					<section>
						<h4 id="example-1-1">Example 1.1 - website with many content authors</h4> 
						<p>A news service takes accessibility very seriously. All functionality, including navigation, search, and subscribing to the news feeds conform to the technical standard. All staff who publish content are required to complete regular training on accessibility, along with the other training they receive on writing. The service provides accessibility checkers and tutorials for its staff, and runs regular scans and spot-checks for accessibility. Anyone can also report issues they find, which are quickly addressed. Despite all that, here and there conformance issues occur. The issues are filed as bugs in the central bug tracking system and are processed according to their severity level, together with other content issues.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4 id="example-1-2">Example 1.2 - application with high degree of complexity</h4>
						<p>A service provider creates a tool that allows users to create complex forms and questionnaires. It has ready-made components like checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-down menus, sliders, and other form controls that users can combine to create their own online forms. Each component conforms to the technical standard on its own as well as in combination with most other components. However, with the growing number of components and possible ways of combining them, it is no longer possible to exhaustively test every possible permutation. Despite all efforts of the service provider to avoid conflicting combinations, they do occur in some situations. This is not limited to accessibility, and also other issues can occur. When such issues are reported, they are filed as bugs and treated based on their severity level in a consistent way.</p>
					</section>
					<p><strong>How technical standards might contribute to addressing this situation</strong></p>
					<p>Example provisions that technical standards could define to help address this situation include: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Define severity levels for accessibility requirements and issues based on their impact on people with disabilities.</li>
    					<li>Define where possible tolerances and quality levels for accessibility requirements, for example to distinguish between inadequate, sufficient, and good implementations of the requirements.</li>
    					<li>Define consistent ways for content providers to provide mechanisms for users to report accessibility issues they encounter. An example of such a mechanism might include contact information provided by the content provider in an accessibility statement. </li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>How accompanying guidance might contribute to addressing this situation</strong></p>
					<p>Example guidance to help address this situation could include: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide examples to illustrate the situation and potential approaches to help address the situation (similar to the examples in this document).</li>
    					<li>Provide examples of good practices in writing accessibility statements (in human- and machine-readable formats). </li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>How accessibility policies might contribute to addressing this situation</strong></p>
					<p>Example considerations that accessibility policies could adopt to help address this situation: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Define accessibility oversight and tolerance levels in content. This could include considerations for:
						<ul>
							<li>type and volume of the content in question</li>
        					<li>frequency in which the content is used</li>
        					<li>importance of the content to the core purpose of the overall online presence (website, app, ...)</li>
        					<li>relative priority of the content for people with disabilities</li>
        					<li>how accessibility bugs are addressed in relation to the impact they may have on specific groups of people</li>
        					<li>any systematic exclusion of accessibility versus evolving improvements</li>
        					<li>size and capability of the content provider</li>
        					<li>potential alternatives and compromise solutions</li>
        					<li>applicable reasonable efforts concepts</li>
						</ul></li>
						<li>Define acceptable grace periods for addressing identified bugs for the different types of content, also based on the considerations listed above. For example, the acceptable periods for healthcare content may be different than for entertainment, and the acceptable levels for time-sensitive information (such as safety alerts, announcements, and such) may be different than other types of information. </li>
					</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="situation-2">Situation 2: When large volumes of content are accumulating too rapidly to make fully conforming </h3>
				<p>In this situation the continually compounding content makes it prohibitive for the content provider to ensure full conformance of the entire content. 
				</p>
					<section>
						<h4 id="example-2-1">Example 2.1 - content being generated by users:</h4> 
						<p>An online shop provides functionality for users to provide product reviews. The online shop receives thousands of reviews each day, each of which can include formatted (rich) text, images, and video content. The online shop provides help pages with information on accessibility good practice, with specific suggestions for users. The online shop is programmed in such a way that accessibility issues in the content generated by users does not interfere with the accessibility of other content. For example, audio uploaded by users cannot be set to play automatically. It also allows users to provide textual descriptions for images, and captions and audio/visual descriptions for videos that are uploaded by users. For several languages, the online shop provides captions that are automatically generated for the user to correct before publishing the reviews. Despite these measures, the shop operator cannot guarantee conformance of all the reviews it continually receives. It indicates the potential accessibility issues in an accessibility statement. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4 id="example-2-2">Example 2.2 - content being generated automatically</h4> 
						<p>A weather station continually publishes satellite and radar images. This includes X images from different cameras every minute. Each image has complex visual information, including cloud formations, atmospheric pressure zones, and wind speeds at different geographic locations. The weather station provides short text alternatives with brief descriptions to identify each image it publishes, including the date, time, and name of the satellite or radar that took the image. For the few images it uses in weather forecasts, it also provides long text alternatives with more detailed descriptions of the image content (to convey the equivalent purpose of the image). These descriptions include the names of the most pertinent cloud formations, atmospheric pressure changes, and wind speeds for selected cities; it does not exhaustively describe all aspects of the images. The weather station indicates to the users which images have and do not yet have detailed descriptions, and describes the limited support for accessibility resulting from images that do not yet have detailed descriptions in an accessibility statement. It notes the rationale for this limitation, and provides a mechanism for users to request a confirming versions of past forecasts, for example for research purposes. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<p><strong>How technical standards might contribute to addressing this situation</strong></p>
					<p>Example provisions that technical standards could define to help address this situation include: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Define the set of accessibility requirements that can be met even under these circumstances. Examples of such requirements might include text alternatives to identify images, videos, and audio, indicating inaccessible content (for example radar images without description of the image content, and videos without audio/text descriptions), supporting users in creating accessible content (for user-generated content), and ensuring that non-conforming content does not impede on the accessibility of other content. [wording for this bullet does not yet have full consensus in the subgroup]</li>
    					<li>Define consistent ways for content providers to provide additional context about accessibility features and barriers in the content they provide. Examples of such context might include specifying which content does and does not yet meet the intended level of conformance, the types of accessibility issues that can occur in the non-conforming content, and the reasons for why these issues may or are known to occur. This context could be made available in human- and machine-readable formats.</li>
    					<li>Define consistent ways for users to contact the content provider for reasonable accommodation needs. </li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>How accompanying guidance might contribute to addressing this situation</strong></p>
					<p>Example guidance to help address this situation could include: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide examples to illustrate the situation and potential approaches to help address the situation (similar to the examples in this document).</li>
    					<li>Provide explanations of the benefits and limitations of automated retrofitting approaches, including for language changes, text alternatives, and captions.</li>
    					<li>Provide examples of good practices in indicating content with and without active support for accessibility, and in writing accessibility statements (in human- and machine-readable formats). </li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>How accessibility policies might contribute to addressing this situation</strong></p>
					<p>Example considerations that accessibility policies could adopt to help address this situation: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Define accessibility oversight and tolerance levels in content. This could include considerations for:
						<ul>
							<li>type and volume of the content in question</li>
        					<li>frequency in which the content is used</li>
        					<li>importance of the content to the core purpose of the overall online presence (website, app, ...)</li>
        					<li>relative priority of the content for people with disabilities</li>
        					<li>how accessibility bugs are addressed in relation to the impact they may have on specific groups of people</li>
        					<li>any systematic exclusion of accessibility versus evolving improvements</li>
        					<li>size and capability of the content provider</li>
        					<li>potential alternatives and compromise solutions</li>
        					<li>applicable reasonable efforts concepts</li>
						</ul></li> 
						<li>Define criteria under which individuals can request conforming versions of the content. This could include considerations for: 
						<ul>
							<li>type and volume of the content in question
    						<li>size and capability of the content provider
    						<li>applicable reasonable efforts concepts
						</ul></li>
					</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="situation-3">Situation 3: When making large volumes of content fully conform is not achievable immediately </h3>
				<p>In this situation the content provider is committed to make specific content conform to the technical standard but has substantial challenges doing so immediately, for example for large volumes of content. 
				</p>
					<section>
						<h4 id="example-3-1">Example 3.1 - making content conform after acquisition: </h4> 
						<p>A company acquired another company with a website/app product that does not fully conform to the technical standard. The acquiring company is now training the relevant content creators, to ensure that all newly created content will conform to the technical standard. Other existing content areas will be revised to conform to the technical standard, usually with the scheduled update of the content. Some content areas will soon be phased out entirely, possibly before they can be made to conform. The acquiring company prioritizes core functionality of the website/app, to make them conform to the technical standard. For example, so that users can browse through all content areas and carry out essential functionality. The company also turned off automatic playback for all videos, also in content areas that were not yet prioritized to make them conform, because audio from the automatically playing video disrupts use of the entire content for some users. The company indicates to the users the accessibility status of the different content areas. The company also provides an accessibility statement with details regarding the plan to revise the courses to meet the applicable accessibility requirements.
						</p>
						<p><strong>How technical standards might contribute to addressing this situation</strong></p>
						<p>Example provisions that technical standards could define to help address this situation include: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Provide guidance on identifying and prioritizing correcting critical errors of non-interference, including:
							<ul>
								<li>The ability to pause or stop all audio content</li>
								<li>No keyboard traps</li>
								<li>The ability to pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating content</li>
								<li>No three flashes or below threshold</li>
							</ul></li>
							<li>Provide guidance on identifying and prioritizing correcting critical errors related to core functionality or core task completion. 
							<ul>
								<li>The organization identifies the core functionality, processes, and tasks to accomplish.</li>
								<li>The organization evaluates whether these are accessible. </li>
								<li>The organization identifies what content is not accessible in a prominent location. </li>
							</ul></li>
							<li>Provide guidance on what is required in an accessibility statement when content is acquired. </li>
							<li>Provide guidance on how to prominently display accessibility information. </li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>How accompanying guidance might contribute to addressing this situation</strong></p>
						<p>Example guidance to help address this situation could include: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Consult the W3C Maturity Model for guidance in prioritizing and training. </li>
							<li>Provide explanation of critical errors and how to identify them. </li>
							<li>Provide explanation of how to test with assistive technologies</li>
							<li>Provide links to training documentation</li>
							<li>Provide tool for generating accessibility statements</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>How accessibility policies might contribute to addressing this situation</strong></p>
						<p>Example considerations that accessibility policies could adopt to help address this situation: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>see the accessibility policy section below.  </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4 id="example-3-2">Example 3.2 - adapting content to changed requirements: </h4> 
						<p>The website and app of an organization conforms to a certain version of a technical standard, such as WCAG. A new version of that technical standard changes some of the accessibility requirements. For example, some of the requirements were modified, others removed, and yet others added to the technical standard. The organization wants to continue conforming to the technical standard but cannot update all its content and applications to conform to the new version of the technical standard immediately. For example, some of the tables and forms are generated by a content management system (CMS) that does not yet support the latest technical standard that the organization wants to meet. The organization prioritizes requirements that it can address more quickly. For example, it changes the visual design to address a new calculation for color luminosity that is introduced in the new technical standard. The organization also has a plan for addressing the remaining accessibility requirements. It indicates to the users the accessibility status of the different content areas and provides an accessibility statement with details regarding the plan to transition the content to the new technical standard.

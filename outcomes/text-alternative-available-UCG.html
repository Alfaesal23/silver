			<h1>Outcome: Text alternative available for user generated content</h1>
			<p class="outcome">If the content is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#user-generated-content">user generated content</a>, then a text alternative mechanism for non-text content is available via user agents and assistive technologies. This mechanism allows users who are unable to perceive and / or understand the non-text content to determine its meaning. The publisher of the user generated content:  </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Provides functionality for adding non-text content, then authors are able to modify programmatically associated text alternatives for non-text content (from B.2.3.1 Alternative Content is Editable - ATAG 2.0 [Level AA])</li>
				<li>Provides functionality to check if) Generic strings (e.g. "image") and irrelevant strings (e.g. the file name, file format) are not used as text alternatives (from No Generic or Irrelevant Strings in B.2.3.2 Automating Repair of Text Alternatives - ATAG 2.0 [Level A]</li>
				<li>If the repair attempt occurs during an authoring session, authors have the opportunity to accept, modify, or reject the repair attempt prior to insertion of the text alternative into the content (from In-Session Repairs in B.2.3.2 - ATAG 2.0 [Level AA]).</li>
				<li>If the repair attempt occurs after an authoring session has ended, the repaired text alternatives are indicated during subsequent authoring sessions (if any) and authors have the opportunity to accept, modify, or reject the repair strings prior to insertion in the content (from (c) Out-of-Session Repairs in  B.2.3.2 Automating Repair of Text Alternatives - ATAG 2.0 [Level AA]). </li>
				<li>Provides the functionality for adding non-text content, when authors enter programmatically associated text alternatives for non-text content AND the text alternatives are automatically saved and suggested by the authoring tool, if the same non-text content is reused (from (a) Save and Suggest in B.2.3.3 Save for Reuse - ATAG 2.0 [Level AAA]). </li>
				<li>Provides the functionality for adding non-text content, when authors enter programmatically associated text alternatives for non-text content AND the author has the option to edit or delete the saved text alternatives (from Edit Option in B.2.3.3 Save for Reuse - ATAG 2.0 [Level AAA]).
